The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a web-based application designed to streamline and digitalize the operations of healthcare facilities. 
The system provides a centralized platform to manage hospital records, patient details, appointments, and billing processes efficiently.

The hospital module maintains information related to departments, and available doctors, enabling better organization and accessibility.
The patient module stores patient details such as demographics, medical history, and admission records, ensuring quick retrieval of data when required. 
The appointment module allows patients to schedule consultations with doctors, reducing waiting times and improving service efficiency.
The billing module automates the generation of bills, including consultation charges, treatment costs, and medicine expenses, thereby minimizing human errors and ensuring transparency.
